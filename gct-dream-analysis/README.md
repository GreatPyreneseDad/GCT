# GCT Dream Analysis Engine

A novel application of Grounded Coherence Theory (GCT) to analyze dreams and subconscious patterns. This system applies the mathematical framework of emotional superposition and coherence dynamics to understand the hidden narratives of our sleeping minds.

## Overview

The Dream Analysis Engine uses GCT's four fundamental dimensions to analyze dreams:

- **ψ (Psi)**: Clarity and vividness of dream imagery
- **ρ (Rho)**: Depth of symbolic meaning and wisdom
- **q**: Emotional intensity and charge
- **f**: Social/archetypal connections

## Features

- **Dream Journal Analysis**: Process written dream descriptions
- **Coherence Tracking**: Monitor subconscious coherence over time
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify recurring themes and symbols
- **Emotional Mapping**: Visualize emotional superposition in dreams
- **Insight Generation**: AI-powered interpretation and guidance
- **Sleep Quality Correlation**: Link dream coherence to sleep patterns

## Theory

Dreams represent a unique state where the conscious filters are removed, allowing pure emotional and symbolic content to emerge. By applying GCT analysis, we can:

1. Measure the coherence of subconscious processing
2. Track psychological integration over time
3. Identify periods of breakthrough or crisis
4. Understand emotional processing patterns

## Installation

```bash
cd gct-dream-analysis
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Usage

1. Enter your dreams in the journal interface
2. View coherence analysis and visualizations
3. Track patterns over time
4. Receive personalized insights

This adaptation demonstrates how GCT's universal principles of human coherence can be applied beyond financial markets to the deepest aspects of human experience.
