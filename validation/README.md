# Validation Utilities

Utilities for validating GCT data and configuration files are kept in this folder. The main script, **`gct_validator.py`**, performs simple checks on datasets or model outputs to ensure they conform to expected formats.

Run the validator with:

```bash
python gct_validator.py <path_to_data>
```

Contributions of additional validation scripts are welcome.
