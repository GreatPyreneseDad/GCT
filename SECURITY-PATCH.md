Updated all Python dependencies in `gct-market-sentiment/requirements.txt` to latest secure versions:

- streamlit: 1.28.0 → 1.31.0
- pandas: 2.1.0 → 2.2.0
- numpy: 1.24.0 → 1.26.3
- plotly: 5.17.0 → 5.18.0
- sqlalchemy: 2.0.0 → 2.0.25
- websocket-client: 1.6.0 → 1.7.0
- aiohttp: 3.9.0 → 3.9.3

- transformers: 4.35.0 → 4.36.2
- torch: 2.1.0 → 2.2.0
- nltk: 3.8.0 → 3.8.1
- scipy: 1.11.0 → 1.12.0
- scikit-learn: 1.3.0 → 1.4.0
- networkx: 3.2 → 3.2.1
- pytest: 7.4.0 → 7.4.4

### JavaScript Dependencies

#### soulmath-moderation-system

Fixed critical and high severity vulnerabilities:
- form-data: Updated via npm audit fix
- on-headers: Updated via npm audit fix
- compression: Updated via npm audit fix

Remaining vulnerabilities are in the react-scripts@5.0.1 dependency chain:
- nth-check (high severity) - in svgo/css-select chain
- postcss (moderate severity) - in resolve-url-loader
- webpack-dev-server (moderate severity)

These vulnerabilities are in development dependencies and don't affect production builds. The issues are being tracked by the react-scripts maintainers.

### Recommendations

1. **For Python dependencies**: Run `pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade` to apply updates
2. **For JavaScript dependencies**: 
   - The remaining vulnerabilities are in the build toolchain, not runtime dependencies
   - Consider migrating from react-scripts to Vite for better security and performance
   - Monitor react-scripts for updates that address these issues

### Security Best Practices Applied

1. Updated all direct dependencies to latest secure versions
2. Removed unused dependencies where possible
3. Applied npm audit fixes where they don't break functionality
4. Documented remaining issues for future resolution

## Verification Steps

1. Test Python application functionality:
   ```bash
   cd gct-market-sentiment
   pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade
   python -m pytest
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

2. Test JavaScript application:
   ```bash
   cd soulmath-moderation-system
   npm test
   npm run build
   ```

## Notes

- GitHub Dependabot will continue to monitor and alert for new vulnerabilities
- Regular dependency updates should be scheduled monthly
- Consider implementing automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
