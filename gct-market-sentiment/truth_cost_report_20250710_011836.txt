============================================================

THEORETICAL FOUNDATION:
Truth Cost measures the energy required to maintain patterns that
deviate from natural market coherence. High truth costs indicate
unsustainable behaviors that will eventually revert.

MARKET-WIDE SUMMARY:
============================================================
Average Truth Cost:     0.073
High Cost Warnings:     0 tickers
Market Sustainability:  HIGH

INTERPRETATION GUIDE:
â€¢ Truth Cost < 0.2:  Natural, sustainable market behavior
â€¢ Truth Cost 0.2-0.4: Moderate strain, watch for reversals  
â€¢ Truth Cost > 0.4:  High strain, unsustainable patterns
â€¢ Truth Cost > 0.6:  Extreme - expect significant corrections

INVESTMENT IMPLICATIONS:
- High truth cost stocks likely to revert to mean
- Low truth cost with high coherence = sustainable trends
- Rising cumulative costs signal exhaustion points
- Wisdom/Emotion < 1 indicates emotional extremes
