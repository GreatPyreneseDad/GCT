# GCT Playlist Engine

This experimental module applies Grounded Coherence Theory to music streaming.
It contains skeleton classes for fetching audio data, extracting features, and
optimizing playlists with coherence metrics.

The implementation is intentionally lightweight and leaves external integrations
(e.g. music catalogs, NLP models) as placeholders.
