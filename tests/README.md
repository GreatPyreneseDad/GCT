# Test Suite

The `tests` directory contains automated tests for verifying the reference implementations in this repository. All new features should include accompanying tests when possible.

To run the full suite:

```bash
pytest
```

The tests rely only on the standard library and the helper functions included in the repository, so no additional dependencies are required.
