> *"In the convergence of consciousness and computation, coherence reveals the hidden patterns of meaning."*

## 🌟 Overview

This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of **Grounded Coherence Theory (GCT)**, a revolutionary framework for analyzing text coherence, meaning, and authenticity. From philosophical foundations to practical financial applications, GCT bridges the gap between human consciousness research and AI-powered analysis.

### 🔬 What is Grounded Coherence Theory?

GCT is a multi-dimensional framework that measures text coherence through four fundamental variables:

- **Ψ (Psi)** - **Internal Consistency**: Alignment between stated beliefs and expressed ideas
- **ρ (Rho)** - **Accumulated Wisdom**: Depth of integrated learning and pattern recognition  
- **q (Charge)** - **Moral Activation Energy**: Intensity of value-driven language and urgency
- **f (Frequency)** - **Social Belonging**: Connection to collective identity and relationships

### 📊 The GCT Coherence Formula

```
C = Ψ + (ρ × Ψ) + q_optimal + (f × Ψ)
```

Where `q_optimal` uses biological optimization to prevent extremism:
```
q_optimal = (q_max × q) / (K_m + q + (q²/K_i))
```

## 🚀 Projects & Applications

### 1. 📰 **Market Pulse** - Financial News Volatility Analyzer
*Revolutionary financial news analyzer combining GCT with market psychology*

**Location**: `/market_pulse/`

**Features**:
- 🔍 Real-time scraping from 7+ financial news sources
- 🧠 GCT-powered volatility scoring
- 📈 Interactive Wisdom-Panic Matrix visualization
- 🚨 Smart alerts for market-moving events
- 📊 Streamlit dashboard with live data

**Philosophy**: *"High dC/dt in financial news = opportunity or danger!"*

```bash
cd market_pulse
python install.py

## 🔮 Vision & Philosophy

*"In markets, as in consciousness, the derivative tells the story. High dC/dt in financial news reveals the hidden patterns of opportunity and danger."*

GCT represents more than just text analysis—it's a bridge between human intuition and computational intelligence. By measuring coherence across multiple dimensions, we reveal the deep structures of meaning that drive both individual understanding and collective behavior.

From analyzing the coherence of academic papers to detecting market volatility in real-time news, GCT transforms how we understand and interact with information in our interconnected world.

**The future of analysis is coherent. The future is now.**
