# GCT Creative Flow Analysis Module

A novel application of Grounded Coherence Theory to analyze and enhance creative processes, artistic expression, and flow states.

## Overview

The Creative Flow Analysis module extends GCT principles to understand how coherence dynamics influence creativity, artistic expression, and the achievement of flow states. By tracking the interplay between clarity (ψ), wisdom (ρ), emotional activation (q), and social connection (f) during creative processes, we can:

1. **Predict creative breakthroughs** by identifying coherence inflection points
2. **Optimize creative environments** based on individual coherence profiles
3. **Enhance collaborative creativity** through team coherence mapping
4. **Guide artists through creative blocks** using coherence trajectory analysis

## Key Features

### 🎨 Creative State Detection
- Real-time classification of creative states (exploration, incubation, illumination, flow, blocked)
- Pattern recognition for breakthrough prediction
- Flow state depth and duration tracking

### 🧠 Biometric Integration
- Heart rate variability for stress/relaxation balance
- EEG integration for brainwave pattern analysis
- Eye movement tracking for attention patterns
- Galvanic skin response for emotional activation

### 🌟 Creative Metrics
- **Novelty Score**: Originality of creative output
- **Fluency Rate**: Ideas generated per minute
- **Flexibility Index**: Diversity of creative approaches
- **Elaboration Depth**: Detail and development level
- **Flow Intensity**: Depth and stability of flow states

### 🏢 Environment Optimization
- Personalized lighting recommendations
- Soundscape selection based on creative state
- Workspace organization suggestions
- Interruption management protocols

### 👥 Collaborative Features
- Team coherence synchronization analysis
- Optimal collaboration timing
- Role assignment based on coherence profiles

## Installation

```bash
cd gct-creative-flow
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Creative Session Monitoring

```python
from src.creative_flow_engine import CreativeFlowEngine
from src.gct_engine import GCTVariables

engine = CreativeFlowEngine()

# Analyze current creative state
variables = GCTVariables(
    psi=0.6,  # Mental clarity
    rho=0.7,  # Accumulated wisdom
    q_raw=0.5,  # Emotional activation
    f=0.4,  # Social connection
    timestamp=datetime.now()
)

analysis = engine.analyze_creative_state(variables)
print(f"Creative State: {analysis['creative_state']}")
print(f"Flow Score: {analysis['flow_analysis']['flow_score']}")
print(f"Breakthrough Probability: {analysis['breakthrough_probability']}")
```

### With Biometric Data

```python
from src.creative_flow_engine import BiometricData

biometrics = BiometricData(
    hrv=0.65,  # Heart rate variability
    eeg_alpha=0.7,  # Alpha waves (relaxed focus)
    eeg_theta=0.6,  # Theta waves (creativity)
    eeg_gamma=0.4,  # Gamma waves (insight)
    gsr=0.3,  # Galvanic skin response
    eye_movement_entropy=0.5,  # Visual exploration
    posture_stability=0.8  # Physical stillness
)

analysis = engine.analyze_creative_state(variables, biometrics)
```

## Creative States

The system recognizes these creative states based on coherence patterns:

### 🔍 Exploration
- **Coherence Pattern**: Low ψ (0.3-0.5), High q (0.6-0.8)
- **Characteristics**: Divergent thinking, idea generation, playful experimentation
- **Optimization**: Stimulating environment, varied inputs, social interaction

### 🌙 Incubation
- **Coherence Pattern**: High ρ (0.7-0.9), Low q (0.2-0.4)
- **Characteristics**: Subconscious processing, rest, pattern formation
- **Optimization**: Relaxed environment, minimal stimulation, solo time

### 💡 Illumination
- **Coherence Pattern**: High ψ (0.8-1.0), Positive dC/dt (>0.1)
- **Characteristics**: "Aha!" moments, sudden insights, breakthrough clarity
- **Optimization**: Capture tools ready, minimal distractions, recording capability

### 🌊 Flow
- **Coherence Pattern**: High overall coherence (>0.75), Stable dC/dt (-0.02 to 0.02)
- **Characteristics**: Effortless focus, time distortion, peak performance
- **Optimization**: Matched challenge level, clear goals, immediate feedback

### 🚧 Blocked
- **Coherence Pattern**: Low coherence (<0.3), High q (>0.8), Low ψ (<0.3)
- **Characteristics**: Frustration, mental fog, creative paralysis
- **Optimization**: Break activities, environment change, social support

- **Teacher Training**: Help educators recognize and nurture creative states
- **Classroom Design**: Optimize learning spaces for creativity

## Theoretical Foundation

### Creativity as Coherence Oscillation
Unlike productivity, creativity thrives on controlled coherence oscillation between states. The system recognizes that creative breakthroughs often emerge from periods of low coherence (exploration/incubation) followed by rapid coherence increases (illumination).

### The Creative Wisdom Paradox
High wisdom (ρ) can both enhance and inhibit creativity:
- **Enhancement**: Deep pattern recognition enables novel connections
- **Inhibition**: Over-reliance on past patterns blocks innovation
- **Resolution**: Optimal creative ρ oscillates between 0.4-0.7

### Social Creativity Amplification
Group creativity follows non-linear coherence dynamics where synchronized coherence changes can lead to collective breakthroughs.

## Privacy & Ethics

- All biometric and creative data is processed locally
- No creative work is analyzed without explicit consent
- Focus on enhancement, not replacement of human creativity
- Commitment to preserving creative diversity and individual expression

## Future Developments

- **Cross-media analysis**: Coherence patterns across different creative mediums
- **AI creative partnership**: Adaptive AI that responds to creator's coherence state
- **Large-scale collaboration**: Coherence optimization for massive creative projects
- **Quantum creativity**: Exploring superposition states in creative processes
