# Changelog

All notable changes to the GCT (Grounded Coherence Theory) project will be documented in this file.

## [v1.0.0] - 2025-01-17

### üéâ Initial Release - GCT Market Sentiment Module

This is the first official release of the Grounded Coherence Theory implementation suite, featuring the Market Sentiment Analysis Engine.

### ‚ú® Core Features

#### Market Sentiment Engine
- **Real-time Financial News Analysis**: Processes financial news through GCT framework to detect coherence shifts
- **Advanced Sentiment Detection**: Goes beyond keyword matching using psychological dynamics modeling
- **Multi-ticker Support**: Tracks SPY, QQQ, AAPL, MSFT, GOOGL, META, AMZN, NVDA, TSLA
- **Predictive Signals**: 
  - Bullish: dC/dt > 0.05 (rising narrative coherence)
  - Bearish: dC/dt < -0.05 (falling narrative coherence)
  - Spike alerts: |d¬≤C/dt¬≤| > 0.1 (rapid coherence acceleration)

#### GCT Mathematical Framework
- **Coherence Equation**: C = Œ® + (œÅ √ó Œ®) + q^optimal + (f √ó Œ®)
- **Biological Optimization**: q^optimal = (q_max √ó q) / (K_m + q + q¬≤/K_i)
  - K_m = 0.2 (cooperation threshold)
  - K_i = 0.8 (competition threshold)
- **Components**:
  - œà (Psi): Clarity and precision of narratives
  - œÅ (Rho): Reflective depth and analytical nuance
  - q (Q): Emotional charge with wisdom modulation
  - f (F): Social belonging and market consensus

#### Dashboard & Visualization
- **Streamlit Dashboard**: Interactive real-time coherence monitoring
- **Truth Cost Calculator**: Visualizes coherence patterns across market conditions
- **Historical Analysis**: Track coherence evolution over time
- **Export Capabilities**: CSV, JSON, and report generation

#### Data Pipeline
- **Tiingo Integration**: Real-time news and price data
- **SQLite Database**: Efficient local storage with schema optimization
- **Background Processing**: Continuous data collection service
- **Alert System**: Email/webhook notifications for critical coherence shifts

### üöÄ Additional Modules

#### Fear Elevation System
- SoulMath implementation for fear-to-wisdom transformation
- Real-time fear detection in AI systems
- Mathematical model: Elevation = (Fear √ó Coherence¬≤) / (1 + Fear)
