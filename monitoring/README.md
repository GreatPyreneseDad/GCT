# Monitoring Tools

This directory houses simple utilities used to monitor coherence metrics while other GCT services are running.

Currently it contains **`coherence_monitor.py`**, a lightweight script that can be extended to track system metrics or log real‚Äêtime coherence values. The monitor can be executed directly and configured to point at different services or log files.

Additional monitoring scripts can be placed here as the project grows.
